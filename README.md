# Getting Started With Typeeee

Everything is setup already for you. Just open this project in `Command Prompt` and run this command if nodejs is already installed in your machine.

```bash
npm run watch
```

This command will watch your `HTML` and `Typescript` files and will compile them into CSS and JavaScript. Start with `index.htm` file, and for your typescript code start writing code in `scripts/index.ts` file.
